# Core Java Programs

## Description
This repository contains multiple Core Java programs for practice and learning.  
It includes programs on arrays, patterns, recursion, functions, operators, keywords, loops, control statements, strings, StringBuilder, sorting algorithms, bit manipulation, mathematical operations, odd/even checks, prime number checks, multiplication tables, and more.

## Technologies
- Java SE
- Core Java concepts (OOP, loops, arrays, recursion, functions, operators, strings)
- Optional: Any IDE like VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA

## Programs List (Topics Covered)
1. **Arrays** – Basic operations, traversals, and manipulations  
2. **Patterns** – Star, number, and character patterns  
3. **Recursion** – Factorial, Fibonacci, and other recursive problems  
4. **Functions / Methods** – Custom functions and method calls  
5. **Operators & Keywords** – Arithmetic, logical, and relational operations  
6. **Loops & Control Statements** – for, while, do-while, if-else, switch-case  
7. **Strings & StringBuilder** – String manipulations, concatenation, reverse  
8. **Sorting Algorithms** – Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort  
9. **Bit Manipulation** – Bitwise operations, shifts, AND, OR, XOR  
10. **Mathematical Operations** – Odd/even checks, prime numbers, multiplication tables  
11. **Other small programs** – Miscellaneous coding exercises
